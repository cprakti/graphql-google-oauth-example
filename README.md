## GraphQL Google OAuth Workshop

### Introduction

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

**Goal**: The purpose of this app is to practice using graphQL and Google OAuth to successfully authenticate in an app.

**Learning Objectives**:

1. understand basic OAuth pattern
2. understand how to use graphQL to obtain a token from your server

### Setup

If you have not already, please install:

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

1. Run `yarn install` in both `/client` and `/server`.
2. To start the client, navigate to `client` and run `yarn start`. Visit [locahost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to see
   your appplication.
3. To start the server, start mongoDB with `mongod` in a separate tab. Then, navigate to `server` and run `node src/app.js`.

### Guide

1. Prompt authentication provider login.

2. Store access token on the client.

3. Send access token to your server as part of a graphQL mutation.

4. Verify the token recieved by your server and request user infromation from provider.

5. Save the userâ€™s data from the provider's response to your database.

6. Create and return a JWT to the client for protected requests

**Not Covered**

7. Client saves JWT and uses token for all authenticated requests

8. Server uses JWT to allow or deny request and identify current user
